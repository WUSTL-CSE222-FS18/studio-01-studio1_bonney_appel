# Part 1: Choose your own IoT Adventure

These will be timed activities.  Please note the timer and be sure to use your time wisely.

## Part 1.1: Picking a Mission (7 minutes)

Your group will be both a "Customer" and a "Designer".  First you'll prepare for your Customer role.  Browse through the "Mission" cards and select the one that interests you. You may use either the specific example on the card or be creative and try to develop another example that fits the goal given on the card. Any discussions with  Designers should not reveal the specific example you have in mind.  Try to really think about the example and how it would fit into your life as a customer. Try to build an entire story around it.  Make sure you have a clear vision in mind.

***Q1.1 Briefly describe your Mission:***

I need something that helps me wake up and start my morning quicker. My morning cup of coffee cannot be delayed.

## Part 1.2: Finding a Designer/Customer (3 minutes)

Find another group to work with. The other group should be students who neither of you have worked with before and far enough away that they didn't overhear any of your discussion of your Mission. One group will be "Designers" while another is "Customers".  Then the groups will switch roles (so each will be a Designer while the other is a Customer).  Pick which group is "Designing" first.

## Part 1.3 Empathizing (13 minutes total)

(7 minutes) The Designer's first step in design thinking is empathizing with the person who the design is for.  The Designer should have a conversation with the Customer to get to know them and to ask about the Customer's needs and interests.  The goal is to try to identify the customer's need, *not a specific solution*.  The Designers who are going first should interview the customer and try to figure out the underlying need they'd like to satisfy.  

***Q1.2 Share some notes from your interview here and try to describe the "need" with a very brief description:***

They need a way to tell the bar/waiter when a drink is empty and needs to be filled, and what they want to drink without having to walk to the bar/wait for the waiter.

(6 minutes) Reverse roles. The Customers are now Designers and vice versa.  Repeat the interview process. (Designers, complete the question above in that space)

## Part 1.4: Proposing solutions (8 minutes)

Return to your original locations.  In this step all groups will act like Designers.  Another vital aspect of design thinking is open-minded brainstorming about potential solutions that will fulfill the Customer's needs.   Review your notes about the Customer's needs.  Use cards from the Things, Services, Human Actions, and Feedback decks to *design two (2) or more different solutions* to the Customer's needs.

***Q1.3 Briefly describe your solutions (use a list) and any strengths/weaknesses you see.***

1. Smart Table: A pad in the center that you put your cup on and alerts the bar/waiter that a cup needs to be refilled. Would also have a screen for drink customization.
    * Lets people order whatever drink they want as soon as their cup is empty.
    * Has to wait for drink to be empty to alert that a new drink is needed.
    * Allows customer choose the drink they want, and change refill easily.
1. Smart Cup: A cup that monitors liquid levels in the cup and automatically alerts the bar/waiter when the cup is below a certain level (adjustable by customer). Would also have a button for general assistance.
    * Customizable to individual needs, so the thirsty customer could order a refill when their drink is half full, or a slower customer could get their refill when the drink is completely empty (or no refill at all).
    * Does not have a way to choose the kind of drink ordered/refilled, but could be preprogrammed to follow a path (ie sample the local beers) or be associated with a single drink (refill a soda).

## Part 1.5: Feedback (10 minutes total)

Meet with your corresponding group again. And, again, select which set will be Designers first.

(5 minutes) Designers:  Present your solutions and get the Customers' feedback.  As a Designer you should be open to any initial reactions.  Customers: think carefully about your original "need" and try to give both pros and cons of the proposed solutions.

***Q1.4 Designers: Briefly summarize their feedback for each solution:***

1. The smart table seemed close to what they wanted. The only feedback was to make sure it could offer refill alerts before the drink was empty.
2. The smart cup proposed was less flexible and more expensive, but had the personalized option that the table did not.

(4 minutes): Reverse roles.  Designers: Fill in your answers to the question above.

## Part 1.6: Iteration (6 minutes)

Return to your original seats.

In this phase everyone is thinking like a Designer.  Design thinking also relies on iterative refinement of work to suite the Customer.  Are there ways it could be improved?  Discuss the feedback and refine/update your work if needed.

***Q1.5 Based on the feedback, how might you change your solution?***

We would add a weight sensor to the smart table, allowing customization of when you want the drink refilled (or if you want it refilled at all). It would also offer the option to purchase smart cups that could be associated with a person and know what their drink is, but would not need them.

## Part 1.7 Evaluation (5 minutes)

Switch back to being a Customer and thinking about the product you want and the need it should meet.  Pick three (3) Criteria cards that are most important to you and order them from most important to least important.

***Q1.6 List your three top Criteria:***

1. Utility
1. User Friendly
1. Feasibility

## Part 1.8: More Feedback (10 minutes total)

Meet with your corresponding group again. And, again, select which set will be Designers first.

(5 minutes) Designers: Present your revised, final solutions and get the Customers' feedback.  Customers: Evaluate the proposed solution based on the Criteria you selected.

***Q1.7 Briefly summarize your findings as a Designer.  Is the customer happy with your work?  How could it be further improved?***

Yep. We even offered more than they wanted as optional features.

***Q1.8 Briefly summarize your findings as a Customer.  Will the proposed solution meet your needs?  Was it substantially different than what you may have initially envisioned?***

Yep, it works. It was about the same as we envisioned.

(5 minutes): Reverse roles.  Designers and Customers: Fill in your answers to the question above.

## Part 2: Summary

### Review

Part of the goal of today's studio was to provide you some "menus" for:
   - common ingredients in IoT systems,   
   - scenarios where IoT may be of value, and
   - some criteria that can be used to evaluate the value of IoT systems.

***Q2.1 Without reviewing the cards, provide three examples of each type of card along with a brief description (try your best).  Add your answers as a sub-list for each type here:***
- Criteria
    * Utility - how effective is it?
    * Feasibility - How easy to implement?
    * User Friendly - How easy to use?
- Things
    * Furniture
    * Smart House
    * Coffee Cup
- Services
    * Financial
- Feedback
    * (cant remember)
- Human Actions
    * (cant remember)
- Missions
    * Teleportation - 'sends you to a different time/place'
    * Tangibles - does something useful without needing a screens
    * Trojan Horse - does something other than primary function


### Contrast

***Q2.2 In Studio 0 you were supposed to evaluate three examples of IoT. In many cases the examples may not be able to be represented using the cards.  Provide some examples of cards that you think should be added to the deck, either based on the examples from Studio 0, or from this Studio, or based on your own interests.  Be sure to specify the suit (Mission, Thing, Services, Human Interactions, Feedback, and Criteria) as well as a brief description:***

Wearables (other than smart watches), Transportation
